Adding Attachments
``````````````````
To attach a file to your shift report, click "Attach" at the bottom of the list of fields. Choose a file, then click "Upload." 

Saving
``````
The report is automatically saved after every change and when you leave the page. You may also save at any time by clicking the "Save" button in the upper right corner of the report area.

Collaborative Editing
`````````````````````
Shift reports can be edited by multiple users simultaneously. However, due to network latency editing the same block from multiple locations can lead to "choppy" behavior. Currently, newly-added blocks will not appear in others' browsers until the page is reloaded.

The report view page also updates in real time if the report is being edited.

Removing a Block
````````````````
To remove a block from your report, click the trash can icon in the upper right corner of the block. Note that this operation is irreversible.

Remote Assistance
`````````````````
If you need help with a shift report, ask an expert. Send them the link at the top of the page, and they can see your report in real time as you modify it.
